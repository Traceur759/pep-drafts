This repository collects Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) drafts for
collaboration before they are sent to CPython's PEP repository.

A link to the rendered versions of the documents in this repository is at the
top of the GitHub page.
(If you aren't looking at GitHub, visit the `rendered pages for the original repo`_.)

.. _rendered pages for the original repo: https://fedora-python.github.io/pep-drafts/index.html

If you have a comment, please open an issue, or submit a pull request!
If you want to add a new PEP, clone the repo and go ahead.

To render the drafts as HTML locally, use ``make html``.

To render into a ``gh-pages`` Git branch suitable for pushing,
``pip install --user ghp_import``, then use ``make gh-pages``.
Then push the resulting branch (``git push origin gh-pages``).
Make sure to update the link on your repo's GitHub repository to point to your
version of the rendered files.
